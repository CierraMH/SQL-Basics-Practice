# SQL-Basics-Practice Reflection 
I learned about a lot of the general SQL commands using W3Schools such as the Existing command to see if any record is available for what I am looking for. Using my general command prompt I did run into trouble trying to create the database as the "CREATE DATABASE' did not work well but after a little research, I found that using the SQLite downloads provided that I could create the database by simply adding the name I wanted with '.db' after. And from there everything ran as it should and with the commands shown in W3School.

# SQL Query Practice and Database Modification Reflection
So far I really enjoy SQL query and all that it offers. I somewhat wish that we had the options that databases provided a bit sooner as some of my past assignments may have been a bit easier not having to create new data. The most challenging part so far is making sure that I have the table name and columns in the right place, but I will confident that with a bit more practice I will be much better at it. I still have a few questions or things I would like to research that involve SQL JOINs and multiple tables data options, but I hope with tomorrow's lecture everything is cleared up.
