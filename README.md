# SQL-Basics-Practice Reflection 
I learned about a lot of the general SQL coomands using W3Schools such as the Existing command to see if any record is available for what I am looking for. Using my general command propmt I did run into trouble trying to create the database as the "CREATE DATABASE' did not work well but after a little research I found that using the SQLite downloads provided that I could create the database by simply adding the name I wanted with '.db' after. And from there everything ran as it should and with the commands shown in W3School..
